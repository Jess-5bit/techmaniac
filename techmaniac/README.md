# Techmaniac

Techmaniac is my entry to Godot Wild Jam #35. It was made entirely by me (JohnGabrielUK), except for the long-suffering Bradinator64 who did some playtesting. It was made with Godot Engine v3.3.2.

The game's code is licensed under GNU GPL v3. The art and music are [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), though I'd be astonished if you actually wanted to use them for something.
